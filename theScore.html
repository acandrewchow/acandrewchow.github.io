          During my first work term, I spent the time working as a QA Analyst on the Promotions team, specifically working on
          theScore's betting app, theScoreBet. This journey was a great experience as I was surrounded by an amazing environment of positive and like-minded
          individuals, while having the opportunity to learn life long goals and skills.

              This journey started back in April where I came across an open posiiton for a QA Analyst
              at theScore. It was extremely busy during this time as I was interviewing for several other
              companies as well as finishing the last of my exams for the school year. After applying, I was reached out 
              a week later where I was offered two interviews. The interview process was smoooth as I had the opportunity 
              to demonstrate my passion for the sports industry, while illustrating my problem solving and critical
              thinking skills. Later that day, I had received a call where I was offered the position. The onboarding process
              was fairly quick as I provided with of the neccessary equipment to start the week after.

              At the start of the internship, there was a lot of information to cover, such as documents, artifacts,
              services, and different software tools. It was overwhelming at first, but after asking a lot of questions
              and understanding the systems it became second nature. Everybody was extremely supportive and helpful whenever
              there were any issues.

              As a QA Analyst, my main focus was on the delivery of high quality releases to satisfy

          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              There were a variety of goals I wanted to accomplish during my time at theScore.
              These goals were a great way to meet different milestones throughout my work term.
