            <p>
              In April I came across an open position for a QA Analyst
              at theScore. It was extremely busy during this time as I was interviewing for several other
              companies as well as finishing the last of my exams for the school year. After applying, I was reached out 
              a week later where I was offered two interviews. The interview process was smooth as I had the opportunity 
              to demonstrate my skills. Later that day, I had received a call where I was offered the position. The onboarding process
              was fairly quick as I provided with of the neccessary equipment to start the week after.

              During the first couple of days at theScore, there was a lot of information to cover during my onboarding, including documents, architecture,
              services, and different software tools. At first it was overwhelming, however everybody was extremely helpful
              which made learning a lot easier. I mainly spent the first couple of weeks playing around with the TSB app, as well
              as understanding the application for the promotions service.

          <h1 class="article-subtitle">My Responsibilities</h1>
          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              As a QA Analyst, my main focus was on the delivery of high quality releases that satisfied
              product requirements to meet user expectations. Some of my work includes:
              <ul class ="duties-list">
                <li>
                  Creating document test plans, test cases and utilize validation techniques for application
                  functionality
                </li>
                <li>
                  Participating in bug prioritizing, priority assessment and coverage tracking of reported bugs
                  within the defect tracking system
                </li>
                <li>
                  Communicating with product, design and executive teams through reports to identify and solve
                  quality issues
                </li>
              </ul>
              More specifically, I spent most of my time working on the promotions service.
              Ranging from performing functional and regression tests, to debugging with Charles there were many
              opportunities to improve the overall accuracy and performance of the promotions service.

          <h1 class="article-subtitle">Goals</h1>

              <p>
                My main goal at theScore as a QA Analyst was to improve the quality of the releases and products for theScore Bet.
                As such, some of my objectives included:
                  <ul class="duties-list">
                    <li>
                      Writing documents and test cases to improve overall coverage and functionality within the promotions service

                    <li>
                      Using Jira to participate in debugging and bug tracking within TSB clients and other 
                      applications
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Planning and executing test plans to ensure objectives are met
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Understanding the product life cycle, including planning, developing and release stages
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                Working at theScore for my first co-op term was a great experience. I had the opportunity to learn a lot
                about the products and architecture. In addition, I learned the importance of providing quality
                features to hundreds of thousands of active users on theScore Bet. Some of my favourite
                work included promotions feature work on the <a href =

                target="_blank"> Viva/Vegas</a> and Parlay+ launch. Both were very large milestones
                that took an all round amazing effort across all teams within the organization.
