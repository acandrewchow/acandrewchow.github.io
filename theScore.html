          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              As a QA Analyst, my main focus was on the delivery of high quality releases that satisfied
              product requirements to meet user expectations. Some of my work includes:
              <ul class ="duties-list">
                <li>
                  Creating document test plans, test cases and utilize validation techniques for application

              </ul>
              More specifically, I spent most of my time working on the promotions service.
              Ranging from performing functional and regression tests, to debugging with Charles there were many
              opportunities to improve the overall accuracy and performance of the promotions service.

          <h1 class="article-subtitle">Goals</h1>
            <div class="article-content">
              <p>
                My main goal at theScore as a QA Analyst was to improve the quality of the releases and products for theScore Bet.
                As such, some of my objectives included:
                  <ul class="duties-list">
                    <li>
                      Writing documents and test cases to improve overall coverage and functionality within the promotions service
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Using Jira to participate in debugging and bug tracking within TSB clients and other 
                      applications
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Planning and executing test plans to ensure objectives are met
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Understanding the product life cycle, including planning, developing and release stages

                  </ul>

                    Similarily, other personal goals that I wanted to accomplish

                    <li>
                      Understanding other areas of software development, including product, design and development teams across

                    <li>
                      Getting involved in people & culture life at theScore, including co-op projects and volunteer opportunities

          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              In April I came across an open position for a QA Analyst
              at theScore. It was extremely busy during this time as I was interviewing for several other
              companies as well as finishing the last of my exams for the school year. After applying, I was reached out 
              a week later where I was offered two interviews. The interview process was smooth as I had the opportunity 
              to demonstrate my skills. Later that day, I had received a call where I was offered the position. The onboarding process
              was fairly quick as I provided with the neccessary equipment to start the following week.
            </p>

          <h1 class="article-subtitle">May 2022</h1>
          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              During the first couple of days at theScore, there was a lot of information to cover during my onboarding, including documents, architecture,
              services, and different software tools. At first it was overwhelming, however everybody was extremely helpful
              which made learning a lot easier. I mainly spent the first couple of weeks playing around with the TSB app, as well
              as understanding the application for the promotions service.

            <div class ="article-content">
              <p>
                For the next couple of months, I worked on different
                tickets for various products. I found it extremely motivating to continue testing these new features 
                knowing that they will be used on a daily basis. July was a very successful month since it was the launch 
                of theScore's in-house tech stack which enhanced the markets and betting capabilities.
              </p>    
              <br>
              <p>
                Near the end of July, I had the opportunity to present a co-op project to the Sr. Leadership team, including the CEO, Directors and HR at theScore.
                Our project was based on a resource that would be used to target new employees that were interested in applying to theScore. We decided 
                to create a prototype website to illustrate theScore's culture; <a href="https://acandrewchow.github.io/theScoreStories/" target="_blank">theScoreStories</a> 
                which talks about theScore including individual stories from current co-op students.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Fast forward to August, theScore had a special volunteer event with partnership with the Blue Jays Foundation. Alongside 100+ theScore employees, we had the opportunity
                to host and lead many games and activities for athletes of all ages for the annual <a href = "https://challengerbaseballcanada.ca/national-jamboree/" target="_blank">Challenger Baseball National Jamboree.</a>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                December being the last month of the year meant for small releases in preparation for the holiday break and New Year. 
                Looking back at the last several months, I had worked on a lot interesting projects/products. Furthermore, I was able 
                to achieve all of my learning goals. From signing off on tickets, to performing neccessary adhoc testing to watching 
                these features come to life, it was an admirable experience.

          <h1 class ="article-subtitle">Conclusion</h1>
            <div class ="article-content">
              <p>
                Working at theScore for my first co-op term was a great experience. I had the opportunity to learn a lot
                the sports betting industry, including what the products and architecture were at theScore. Simarily, I learned a lot about
                quality assurance, performing quality testing, problem solving and identifying critical bugs within the workflow.
                Some of my favourite work included promotions feature work on the <a href = 
                "https://news.scoremediaandgaming.com/news/news-details/2022/Penn-National-Gaming-Achieves-Major-Milestone-with-Launch-of-theScore-Bets-Proprietary-Technology-Stack/default.aspx"
                target="_blank"> Viva/Vegas</a> and Parlay+ launch. Both were very large milestones
                that took an all-round amazing effort across all teams within the organization. 
              </p>    
              <br>
              <p>
                Although this is the end of my first work term, I will miss my colleagues and my time here working at theScore.
                However, I am excited for my future work terms as I want to continue 
                expanding my skills and knowledge in software development.
